        <p>This game explores the connection between mental health and the environment. The more the player nurtures nature, the brighter and more calming the world becomes. The game mechanics reflect the message: you must take care of the world around you to move forward and feel at peace.</p>

          üß† <span>MY WHY</span>
        </div>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by how nature flourishes when given the care it deserves. When I was younger, my grandmother would gently water the garden filled with fluttering butterflies and winding green vines. She'd hand me the watering can, encouraging me to help. Those quiet moments‚Äîcaring for something together‚Äîtaught me to appreciate how life flourishes when nurtured with love. The garden wasn‚Äôt just beautiful‚Äîit was alive with purpose, and it planted the first seeds of inspiration in me.</p>

        <p>Watching plants grow, seasons change, and life return to places once forgotten fills me with awe and hope. Nature has a quiet strength‚Äîit heals, inspires, and connects us to something bigger. Through this game, I want to remind people of the beauty in growth, both in the natural world and within ourselves. We all have the power to nurture and make things bloom, starting with the smallest actions.</p>

          <p><strong>Name:</strong> Daffodil</p>
          <p><strong>Idea:</strong> A nature-loving, happy dog with a vibrant personality, sporting a pattern of leaves, flowers, and earth tones across her fur. She‚Äôs a protector of nature, always on a mission to ensure the environment remains clean and safe from pollution. With her keen sense of smell and sharp instincts, Daffodil is your trusty companion in the fight against environmental harm.</p>

          <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Daffodil is energetic, compassionate, and determined. She embodies the spirit of nature and always looks for ways to help her surroundings. With a deep connection to the environment, she acts as a protector‚Äîguiding players to clean up and restore balance. Her playful and empathetic nature makes her the perfect companion for every mission.</p>

          <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Daffodil wasn‚Äôt always a nature guardian. She grew up in a small town near a forest, playing and chasing butterflies. But when pollution began harming the environment, Daffodil made it her mission to protect the natural world. One day, an ancient owl granted her the ability to communicate with nature, helping her become the eco-warrior she is today.</p>

          <p><strong>Role in the Game:</strong> As a key helper, Daffodil works alongside players to clean up natural habitats, clear trash, and restore balance. Her sharp instincts and communication with nature make her a vital guide throughout the game, ensuring players stay on track while they protect and nurture the environment.</p>
